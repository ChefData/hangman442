## Description of the project: what it does, the aim of the project, and what you learned
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word, and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This project implements the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word, and the user tries to guess it. 

### What the project does
This project requires the programmer to:
    1. Set up the environment
    2. Create the variables for the game
    3. Check if the guessed character is in the word
    4. Create the game class
    5. Code the logic of the game
    6. Refactor and optimise the code
    7. Document the experince

### Aim of the project
The aim of this project is to test my knowledge in the python programming language, in git and GitHub, and the command interface. The project is designed to challenge me to refactor and optimise the code, while documenting my experince.

### Lessons learned
- Created a list and assigned the list to a variable
- Imported the module random and used the random.choice method on the list to generate a new variable
- Asked the user for an input and checked the validaty of the input using the len() function and .isalpha method
- Used an if statement to communcate validaty of input back to the user
- Updated the GitHub repository with the latest code changes from your local project
- Refactored and optimised code to inculde meaningfull names and eliminate code duplication
- Created a while loop to continuously ask for user input if input was entered incorrectly
- Defined functions to abstract code
